# Anthropilot Web App Prototype

## Overview
Anthropilot is a modern, scalable web platform designed to connect gig workers with robotics companies for real-time, human-in-the-loop support. This prototype demonstrates the full user flow for Tier 1-3 gig workers, including onboarding, task management, performance analytics, and profile management.

## Features
- Modern glassmorphism-inspired UI
- Mobile-first, fully responsive design
- Bottom navigation bar for seamless navigation
- Tier-based task interfaces (visual selection, media upload, robotic control)
- Real-time task dashboard with filtering and prioritization
- Performance analytics and skill development modules
- Profile management, credential display, and documentation hub

## File Structure

| File                   | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `preview.html`         | Integrated preview of all pages and user flow diagram        |
| `login.html`           | Login, signup, onboarding, and tier qualification            |
| `task_dashboard.html`  | Central hub for viewing, filtering, and managing tasks       |
| `task_description.html`| Detailed view and acceptance of individual tasks             |
| `task_interface.html`  | Unified task completion interface (Tier 1-3)                 |
| `worker_dashboard.html`| Performance analytics, task history, and skill modules       |
| `worker_profile.html`  | Profile management, settings, credentials, documentation     |
| `dashboard.html`       | (Legacy) Previous dashboard prototype                        |
| `task.html`            | (Legacy) Previous task interface prototype                   |
| `history.html`         | (Legacy) Previous task history/feedback prototype            |
| `PD.md`                | Product Design documentation                                 |
| `PRD.md`               | Product Requirement Document                                 |

## Usage
1. **Open `preview.html`** in your browser for a holistic, interactive view of the prototype.
2. **Navigate** between pages using the bottom navigation bar or by interacting with the preview grid.
3. **Test user flows**: login, view/accept tasks, complete tasks, review history, and manage your profile.

## Customization & Development
- All pages are static HTML/CSS/JS and require no backend to run.
- To extend functionality (e.g., real authentication, live data), connect to a backend or API.
- Update the navigation links in each HTML file to enable real routing if needed.
- Use the provided design and structure as a foundation for further development.
